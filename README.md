## Deploying to the [Harp Platform](http://harp.io)

Type Brigade uses a somewhat unconventional method of deploying to the Harp Platform. You’ll need to have access to the project on the Harp Platform and the Dropbox shared with you to deploy.

```bash
# Install Autoprefixer and Harp
npm install -g autoprefixer harp

# Compile to your Dropbox
npm run deploy
```

Now, just press Publish on the [Harp Platform](http://harp.io).
