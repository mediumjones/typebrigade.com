# Introducing Type Brigade

During a lecture a few months back, designer Peter Cocking quipped “I find, if you speak about anything for long enough, __it always comes back to type__.”

All the more reason to speak about type it sooner.

I’m excited to announce the Vancouver Typography Meetup Group is now __Type Brigade__. Our first event with our new name will be on [June 23rd] at [Mobify HQ](#), one floor below where _The Elements of Typographic Style_ author Robert Bringhurst allegedly wrote—or so I have been told. [Register for __Type Brigade__ here.](#)

Why the name __Type Brigade__? It signals a change in format: two talks, 25 minutes each, followed by a five minute Q&A. It’s free to attend, with beer and non-alcoholic drinks are provided. Additionally, it’s a commitment to focusing on type design as much as typography.

[Shelley Gruendler](https://twitter.com/dr_shelley) originally created this meetup, and she continues to create amazing opportunities for type designers and typographhers—in [Vancouver](http://www.typecamp.org/camps/vancouver-pointed-pen) and [further away from home](http://www.typecamp.org/incredible-india-2014). I want to thank her for all the time she has invested into getting this meetup where it is.

[With her go-ahead to take over organising and move it in a new direction.] I’m really looking forward to meeting you and—whether you’ve been to an event yet or not—sharing what we have planned.

Looking forward to seeing you [June 23rd](#)!
